# Sysinfo SSE

Simple system monitor.
Built with Rust (axum) and Typescript (react, tailwind), using SSE (Server-Sent Events) for communication.

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about SSE and how to use it in a web application with Rust, Axum and React, a simple system monitor seemed like a good fit for this.
